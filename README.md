# Data-Structure-Projects
These are the projects I did while I was taking Data Structures and Algorithms. The first project is Big Integer, a program that uses linked lists to add, subtract, and multiply the number too large for the int data type. The next is Expression Evaluation a program that takes in an infix expression and evaluates it using stacks and queues while maintaining the order of operations. The third project is a prefix tree generator which take in a series of words from a text file and then generates tree data structures based on the common prefixes of the words. The final project is a friendship graph generator which given a graph data structure showing the relationship between groups of people finds the shortest chain of mutual friends between two people as well as people that share a common clique.
